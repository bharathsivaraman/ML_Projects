Notes for Loan Prediction

Loan Status is the dependent variable. This is a classification problem

Hypostehsis: Variables that can possibly predict (before looking at the dataset)
1. Income level
2. Credit score
3. First time loan buyer
4. Single/ Married
5. Gender
6. Mortgage Value
7. Home owner
8. Education
9. Loan Amount

Thoughts on Dataset: Very small dataset. Challenge will be to find a model that can predict with this small a dataset




Data set: Variables with NAs

1. Gender
2. Married
3. Dependents
4. Self Employed
5. Loan Amount
6. Loan Amount Term
7. Credit History

Applicant income is 0. Quite weird, will check to see if they are classified as N. If not impute with Median within group

Strategy to  handle NA

1. Gender - Find the average applicant income for each Gender and  fill up Gender based on the applicant income
2. Married-  When Dependent is No or null make married as No
3. Dependent -  No Clean trend among data. 
4. Self Employed - - Mean Applicant income
5. Plot Income vs Loan amount and check trend and impute
6. Plot for loan amount term and then impute

Base line model: Base line RF with 6 trees gave a score of 0.53. This is the base model
